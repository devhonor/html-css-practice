## Why Did I Create This Repository?
I created this repository to do not lose project which I did earlier and in future I can check learning progress and building style of mine.

## Are these projects designed by me?
Most of them, no. The aim in this project is practicing mine HTML5 & CSS3 skills. So I do not want to lose time by thinking. But almost in every project I add mine sign like hover lighting, scale animation etc.

## What Else?
In these projects, I try fully responsive design.
