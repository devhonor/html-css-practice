## Why Did I Create This Repository?
I created this repository to do not lose projects which I did earlier and in future I can check learning progress and building style of mine.

## Are These Projects Designed By Me?
Most of them, no. The aim in this project is practicing **pure** HTML5 & CSS3 skills. So I do not want to lose time by designing. But almost in every project I add mine sign like hover lighting, scale animation etc.

## What Else?
In these projects, I use full responsive design concept.
